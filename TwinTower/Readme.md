# TwinTower

TwinTower smart contract is a demo application showing how we can develop a system on blockchain for real estate which can bring more trustability to the 
buyers at the same time it allows users to be the owner of there money.

## Problem Statement

An XYZ construction company is coming up with a new project. The company opens a pre-sale for the customers at the discount rate. 
It wants the customers to book the flat by paying half the amount. The company claims that project will be completed in 3 years. 
Our task is to develop a trustable system on blockchain. 

You can refer to my youtube channel and watch the video, where I have explained all the concepts related to the project.
